# Why Trongate?

I have been looking for something that will allow me to develop websites for quite some time so why alight on Trongate you night ask?

Put simply what attracted me was it's modular structure. Write once, use often. Used correctly this approach should always lead to smaller (in terms of the actual code) faster sites and given that speed is now the primary metric being used toi determine a site's performance with regard to ranking that can't be a bad thing.

The philosophy behind Trongate is simple, a framework devoid of dependencies which should make it more robust and crucially less prone to errors. Roughly translated that equates to stability and for most commercial enterprises that recognise the importance of having an online presence, stability is paramount.

Modularity is a concept I understand well having written many .Net applications that way. Doing the same for websites makes perfect sense to me, so long as I can successfully learn the nuances of PHP, CSS, JavaScript and HTML none of which I think it would be fair to say have ranked highly on my list of programming languages I have an overriding desire to master. That being said one is never too old to learn, and hopefully this documented story of my efforts to master it may just help others on their own roads to mastery./
